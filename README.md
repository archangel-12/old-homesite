Hello? Hey? Hi?

at first, i didn't know that this platform could host a webpage. i admit, i'm a bit late to the party. it kind of sucks for me to realize that in order to publish a webpage through github, you either have to make it publicly available or subscribe (originally i want to make this repo private :) ). uhh anyways, i hope you leave comments on Discussions. yeah, i think that's it. thank you, and stay safe :)
